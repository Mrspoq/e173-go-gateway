## ðŸ”„ Daily Coordination Protocol

### **Morning Standup (Async)**
Each agent updates their GitHub issue with:
- Progress since last update
- Blockers encountered  
- Today's goals
- Integration needs

### **Integration Points**
- **Frontend â†” Backend**: API endpoint coordination
- **Backend â†” AI**: Voice detection integration
- **Database â†” All**: Schema changes coordination
- **DevOps â†” All**: Deployment requirements

### **Conflict Resolution**
- **Orchestrator reviews** all agent updates daily
- **Blockers escalated** within 4 hours
- **Integration conflicts** resolved in shared issues

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

### **Week 1 Targets:**
- [ ] UI fully functional (all sections working)
- [ ] WhatsApp API integrated and caching
- [ ] Basic voice recognition implemented
- [ ] Database optimized for scale
- [ ] Production deployment ready

### **Week 2 Targets:**
- [ ] AI voice agents monetizing spam calls
- [ ] Advanced spam pattern detection
- [ ] Multi-gateway management
- [ ] Full monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Role-based access control

### **Revenue Targets:**
- **SIM Protection**: Save $10,000+ daily (prevent blocking)
- **Spam Monetization**: Generate $500-2,000+ daily  
- **Efficiency**: 90% automated SIM management

## ðŸ“ž Emergency Protocols

### **Critical Issues:**
- **System Down**: DevOps agent immediate response
- **SIM Cards Blocked**: AI agent priority escalation  
- **Revenue Loss**: Backend agent immediate investigation

### **Debug Agent Activation:**
When any agent encounters blockers:
1. Tag `@debug-specialist` in issue
2. Provide error logs and context
3. Debug agent has 2-hour response SLA

This master plan ensures coordinated development with clear responsibilities and tracking!
