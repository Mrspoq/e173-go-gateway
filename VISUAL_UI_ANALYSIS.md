# Visual UI Analysis with Browser Tools MCP

## Screenshot Analysis

### Current Dashboard Issue
Based on the screenshot taken at 12:56:17:
- **Problem**: Dashboard shows only 2 cards taking up the full width
- **Expected**: 5 cards in a single row
- **Root Cause**: Browser is likely caching the old API response

### What I See in the Screenshot:
1. **Card 1**: Modems (0/0 Online) - Red icon, takes 50% width
2. **Card 2**: SIM Cards (0 Low Balance) - Green icon, takes 50% width
3. **Missing**: Active Calls, Spam Calls, and Gateways cards

### Server Response Verification:
The API now correctly returns:
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-5 gap-4" id="stats-cards">
    <!-- 5 cards here -->
</div>
```

### Next Steps:
1. Clear browser cache or force refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check if HTMX is properly swapping content
3. Verify no CSS overrides are affecting grid layout

## Browser Tools MCP Capabilities Confirmed:
✅ **takeScreenshot** - Working perfectly!
✅ **getConsoleLogs** - Available
✅ **getNetworkLogs** - Available
✅ **getConsoleErrors** - Available

Now I can SEE exactly what's happening instead of guessing!
