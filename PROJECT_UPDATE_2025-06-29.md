## 📊 Current System Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Authentication (login/logout)
- ✅ Dashboard with real-time stats
- ✅ Gateway management with testing
- ✅ Customer management
- ✅ Basic CDR display
- ✅ Dark mode support

### Pending Implementation
- ⏳ SIM recharge API endpoints
- ⏳ WebSocket for real-time updates
- ⏳ Asterisk AMI integration
- ⏳ Voice recognition system
- ⏳ CDR filtering and recordings
- ⏳ Customer billing integration

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Week 1)
1. Complete SIM recharge backend API
2. Implement WebSocket server
3. Connect to real Asterisk AMI
4. Add active calls monitoring

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
1. CDR advanced filtering
2. Recording playback
3. Customer prepaid/postpaid types
4. Billing integration

### Future Enhancements
1. Voice recognition integration
2. Multi-tenant support
3. Advanced analytics
4. Mobile app API

## 🔐 Access Information
- Frontend: http://192.168.1.35:8080
- Default credentials: admin/admin123
- Database: PostgreSQL (localhost:5432)
- Redis: localhost:6379

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

1. **SIM Recharge API**: The UI is ready but needs backend endpoints in `/api/v1/sims/recharge`
2. **WebSocket**: Consider using gorilla/websocket for real-time updates
3. **AMI Integration**: The test connection is simulated, needs real AMI client
4. **Database**: All migrations applied up to 009
5. **UI State**: All critical bugs fixed, system is stable

## 🐛 Known Issues
- GitHub MCP server has Node.js version compatibility issues
- Some API endpoints return hardcoded data
- WebSocket infrastructure not implemented
- Voice recognition agents not connected

## 📚 Documentation
- API documentation needed
- Deployment guide pending
- User manual to be created
