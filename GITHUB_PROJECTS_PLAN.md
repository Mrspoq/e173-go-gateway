   - SIP server implementation
   - Database optimizations
   - API development
   - Performance tuning

2. **AI Integration Agent**  
   - Voice recognition models
   - AI voice agents
   - Machine learning pipelines
   - Spam detection algorithms

3. **Frontend/UX Agent**
   - Template fixes
   - Dashboard development
   - Role-based UI
   - Real-time updates

4. **DevOps/Deployment Agent**
   - Cloud infrastructure
   - Docker configurations
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Monitoring setup

## üìä Project Tracking

### Daily Standups via GitHub Issues
- Each agent reports progress daily
- Blockers identified and resolved
- Task dependencies managed
- Code review assignments

### Weekly Sprint Planning
- Review completed tasks
- Plan next week's priorities
- Adjust timelines if needed
- Coordinate cross-agent dependencies

### Integration Points
- **Week 2**: SIP + Filtering integration
- **Week 4**: Multi-gateway + Management integration  
- **Week 6**: Voice AI + Platform integration
- **Week 8**: Full system integration testing

## üéõÔ∏è GitHub Actions Workflows

### Automated Workflows:
1. **Code Quality**: Lint, test, security scan
2. **Build & Deploy**: Automated deployment to staging
3. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component testing
4. **Performance Tests**: Load testing for SIP handling
5. **Agent Coordination**: Auto-assign issues based on labels

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs:
- **SIP Performance**: <100ms call setup time
- **Filtering Accuracy**: >99% spam detection
- **Gateway Uptime**: >99.9% availability
- **Voice Recognition**: >95% accuracy for SIM blocks
- **AI Monetization**: Profitable spam call handling

### Development KPIs:
- **Code Coverage**: >80% for critical components
- **Issue Resolution**: <24h average response time
- **Integration Success**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Agent Coordination**: <4h average handoff time

## üîó Integration Points with Existing Code

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix CSS Loading** (Frontend Agent - Day 1)
2. **Implement SIP Server** (Backend Agent - Day 1)
3. **Create GitHub Project** (Orchestrator - Day 1)
4. **Set up Agent Assignments** (Orchestrator - Day 1)

### Code Preservation:
- Keep existing authentication system
- Maintain database schema (extend for multi-gateway)
- Preserve HTMX frontend framework
- Extend repository pattern for new features

This orchestration plan ensures all agents work in parallel while maintaining code quality and integration points.
