# E173 Gateway - Progress Summary for GitHub Update
## Date: 2025-06-29

### 🎯 What We Accomplished Today

#### 1. MCP Infrastructure Setup ✅
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Successfully configured using Docker
  - Location: `/root/e173_go_gateway/mcp/`
  - Can create issues, update projects, manage repos
  - Created 4 new GitHub issues (#20-#23)

- **Browser Tools MCP**: Installed and working
  - Location: `/root/e173_go_gateway/mcp/browser-tools/`
  - Chrome extension installed
  - Can take screenshots ✅
  - Can monitor console logs ✅
  - Can track network requests ✅
  - CANNOT navigate/reload pages ❌

#### 2. UI Testing Discoveries 🔍
Through Browser Tools MCP screenshots, we discovered:
- Dashboard showing cards vertically (1 per row) instead of horizontally (5 per row)
- The issue persists despite code fixes
- Root cause: Still under investigation (CSS or HTMX issue)

#### 3. Code Changes Made

##### Dashboard Grid Fix Attempts:
```go
// Changed from:
c.String(http.StatusOK, `<div class="bg-white...">`)

// To (with grid wrapper):
c.String(http.StatusOK, `<div class="grid grid-cols-5 gap-4" id="stats-cards">...`)

// Then to (with flexbox):
c.String(http.StatusOK, `<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4" id="stats-cards">...`)

// Finally (with inline styles):
c.String(http.StatusOK, `<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1rem;" id="stats-cards">...`)
```

##### Other Fixes Applied:
- Gateway page CurrentUser handling improved
- Added cache-busting headers to API endpoints
- Fixed compilation errors in recharge_repository.go

#### 4. Current Issues

##### High Priority 🔴
1. **Dashboard Layout**: Still showing 1 card per row instead of 5
2. **Browser Control**: Need way to reload pages remotely for testing
3. **Gateway Page**: Template error with CurrentUser (partially fixed)
4. **Customer Edit**: Redirect to login issue (not yet tested)

##### Medium Priority 🟡
1. CDR empty table display
2. Authentication display in navbar
3. Dark mode initialization

### 🔧 Technical Debt
1. Need browser control solution (Playwright MCP or alternative)
2. Dashboard CSS/grid issues need resolution
3. Template error handling improvements needed

### 📝 Lessons Learned
1. Browser Tools MCP is monitoring-only, not control
2. Visual testing with screenshots is essential
3. HTMX + Tailwind CSS grid interactions need careful handling
4. Cache-busting important for HTMX updates

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Resolve browser control issue (Playwright MCP or xdotool)
2. Fix dashboard grid layout once and for all
3. Test all UI fixes with proper page reloads
4. Complete SIM recharge system implementation
