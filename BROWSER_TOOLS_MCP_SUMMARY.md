## üöÄ Remote Setup Instructions (Mac Client ‚Üí SSH ‚Üí Linux Server)

Since you're using VSCode on Mac with SSH Remote extension, you have two options:

### Option 1: Run Chrome on Your Mac (Recommended)
This is the best approach for your automated testing needs.

1. **Install Chrome Extension on your Mac:**
   - Copy the extension folder from the Linux machine to your Mac:
     ```bash
     # On your Mac terminal:
     scp -r user@your-linux-server:/root/Cline/MCP/BrowserTools-extension/chrome-extension ~/Desktop/BrowserTools-extension
     ```
   - Open Chrome on your Mac and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded extension folder

2. **Configure network access:**
   - The Browser Tools Server is currently listening on the Linux machine at port 3025
   - You need to either:
     a) Set up SSH port forwarding (easiest)
     b) Configure the server to listen on the network IP

3. **Set up SSH Port Forwarding (Recommended):**
   Add this to your SSH connection:
   ```bash
   # When connecting via SSH, add port forwarding:
   ssh -L 3025:localhost:3025 user@your-linux-server
   ```
   
   Or add to your VSCode SSH config:
   ```
   Host your-linux-server
     HostName your-server-ip
     User your-username
     LocalForward 3025 localhost:3025
   ```

### Option 2: Expose Server on Network IP
If you prefer not to use SSH tunneling, we can reconfigure the Browser Tools Server to listen on the network IP (192.168.1.35) instead of localhost.

### Using the Tools:
Once connected, you don't need to manually open DevTools. I (Claude/Cline) can automatically:
1. Take screenshots of any webpage
2. Capture console logs and errors
3. Monitor network activity
4. Run automated audits
5. Debug issues without manual intervention

### Available Commands:
You can now ask me to:
- "Take a screenshot of the current page"
- "Show me the console logs"
- "Check for network errors"
- "Run an accessibility audit on this page"
- "Analyze the page performance"
- "Run an SEO audit"
- "Debug this page" (runs all debugging tools)
- And more!

## üîß Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't connect:
1. Make sure both servers are running (check the terminal windows)
2. Ensure only ONE Chrome DevTools panel is open
3. Try refreshing the page and reopening DevTools
4. Check that the extension is enabled in Chrome

## üìù Configuration Details

The MCP server configuration has been added to:
`/root/.vscode-server/data/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

Both servers are currently running in terminal windows and will continue to run until stopped.
