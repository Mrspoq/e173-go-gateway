# Browser Configuration Issue

## Current Situation

We have **TWO SEPARATE BROWSERS**:

### 1. Google Chrome (with Browser Tools MCP)
- Has Browser Tools extension installed
- Can monitor console logs, network, take screenshots
- **CANNOT** navigate or control the browser
- Running on the desktop

### 2. Playwright Chromium (with Browser Use MCP)
- Fresh Chromium instance launched by Playwright
- **CAN** navigate, click, fill forms
- **CANNOT** access Browser Tools features
- No extensions installed

## The Problem

When we:
1. Use Browser Use to navigate to a page in Chromium
2. Use Browser Tools to check console logs in Chrome
3. **They're looking at different browsers!** ðŸš¨

## Solutions

### Option 1: Connect Browser Use to Existing Chrome
Browser Use MCP supports connecting to an existing browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP):

```bash
# Launch Chrome with remote debugging
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222

# Configure Browser Use MCP
MCP_BROWSER_USE_OWN_BROWSER=true
MCP_BROWSER_CDP_URL=http://localhost:9222
```

### Option 2: Install Browser Tools Extension in Chromium
- Find a way to install the Browser Tools extension in Playwright's Chromium
- This might be complex as Playwright typically runs without extensions

### Option 3: Use Both Separately (Current Approach)
- Use Browser Use for all navigation and interaction
- Manually refresh Chrome to see changes
- Use Browser Tools for monitoring after manual refresh

### Option 4: Use Playwright's Built-in Features
Browser Use (via Playwright) already has:
- Screenshot capability âœ…
- Console log access (via page.on('console'))
- Network monitoring (via page.on('request'))
- We might not need Browser Tools MCP!

## Recommended Solution

**Use Option 1**: Connect Browser Use to the existing Chrome browser where Browser Tools is installed.

This way:
- One browser instance
- Browser Use controls it
- Browser Tools monitors it
- Perfect synchronization!

## Next Steps

1. Configure Chrome to accept remote debugging
2. Update Browser Use MCP to use CDP connection
3. Test that both MCPs work with the same browser
4. Document the unified setup
