# E173 Gateway - Overnight Progress Report
## Date: June 29, 2025

### üéØ Summary
Continued development on the E173 Gateway project after losing previous conversation context. Successfully fixed multiple UI issues, enhanced the settings page, resolved HTMX polling problems, and set up GitHub project management infrastructure.

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### 1. **UI Fixes**
- **Dashboard Card Layout**: Fixed grid layout from 4 to 5 columns for better card organization
- **Dashboard Refresh Issue**: Removed full page refresh on stats update by removing hx-trigger from container
- **Gateways Page**: Fixed routing issue that was showing modems content instead of gateways
- **Customer Stats**: Modified handler to return HTML for HTMX requests instead of JSON
- **Settings Page Enhancement**: Added tabbed interface with Filter, SIP, AMI, and General settings tabs

#### 2. **Gateway Management Improvements**
- **AMI Configuration**: Added comprehensive AMI fields to gateway creation form:
  - AMI Host/IP
  - AMI Port
  - AMI Username
  - AMI Password
- **Gateway List View**: Enhanced to show AMI connection details
- **Template Consistency**: Fixed variable naming (Title ‚Üí title)

#### 3. **HTMX Polling Issue Resolution**
- **Root Cause**: Modems page had `hx-trigger="load, every 10s"` that continued polling even after navigation
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Modified polling triggers to use `from:closest body` for page-specific scoping
  - Added global HTMX cleanup script in base template
  - Handles htmx:beforeSwap events to abort active polling
  - Added pageshow event handler for browser cache cleanup

#### 4. **GitHub Project Management Setup**
- Created comprehensive setup script (`setup_github_project.sh`) with:
  - Project board creation commands
  - 4 Milestones with due dates
  - Epic issues for major features
  - Current sprint issues (import cycle fix, CDR/blacklist fixes, etc.)
- Secured GitHub credentials storage (removed from git, added to .gitignore)

#### 5. **Code Repository Updates**
- Successfully committed all changes with detailed commit message
- Resolved GitHub secret scanning issue by removing credentials from commit
- Pushed all updates to master branch

### üìã Pending Tasks

1. **Remove login button when user is authenticated** (Low priority)
2. **Add customer SIP account management features** (Medium priority)
3. **Resolve import cycle preventing compilation** (High priority - blocking deployment)
4. **Set up Asterisk configuration** (Waiting for user to demonstrate dongle setup)

### üêõ Known Issues

1. **Import Cycle Error**: 
   ```
   imports github.com/e173-gateway/e173_go_gateway/internal/handlers
   imports github.com/e173-gateway/e173_go_gateway/internal/services
   imports github.com/e173-gateway/e173_go_gateway/internal/handlers: import cycle not allowed
   ```
   This prevents the new binary from compiling with all the fixes.

2. **Server Logs**: Still showing repeated `/api/v1/modems` calls, though the fix has been implemented (may require server restart)

### üìÅ Files Modified/Created

#### Modified Templates:
- `templates/base.tmpl` - Added HTMX cleanup script
- `templates/dashboard_standalone.tmpl` - Fixed card grid layout
- `templates/settings_standalone.tmpl` - Enhanced with tabbed interface
- `templates/modems/list.tmpl` - Fixed polling scope
- `templates/modems_standalone.tmpl` - Fixed polling scope
- `templates/sims_standalone.tmpl` - Fixed polling scope
- `templates/gateways/create.html` - Added AMI fields
- `templates/gateways/list.html` - Added AMI connection display

#### New Files:
- `setup_github_project.sh` - GitHub project setup automation
- `PROGRESS_UPDATE_2025-06-28.md` - Previous progress documentation
- `UI_FIXES_UPDATE.md` - Detailed UI fixes documentation
- `migrations/008_add_gateway_modem_relation.sql` - Database migration

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Resolve Import Cycle**: This is the highest priority as it blocks deployment
2. **Run GitHub Project Setup**: Execute the setup script to create project board and issues
3. **Deploy Fixed Binary**: Once import cycle is resolved, deploy the new binary with all UI fixes
4. **Test UI Changes**: Verify all UI fixes work correctly in production
5. **Begin Asterisk Setup**: When user is available to show dongle configuration

### üí° Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Fix the import cycle by refactoring the circular dependency between handlers and services packages
2. **Testing**: Create automated UI tests to prevent regression of fixed issues
3. **Documentation**: Update API documentation for the new gateway AMI configuration endpoints
4. **Monitoring**: Set up proper monitoring for HTMX polling to ensure cleanup is working

### üìä Project Status

- **Phase 1 (Core Platform)**: ~85% complete (pending import cycle fix and deployment)
- **UI/UX**: Major issues resolved, ready for testing
- **GitHub Integration**: Setup scripts ready, awaiting execution
- **Database**: Schema updated with gateway-modem relationships
- **Next Phase**: Ready to begin Asterisk integration once current issues resolved
