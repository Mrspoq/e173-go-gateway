## 🎯 Objectives Completed

### Critical UI Fixes (All Completed ✅)
- Gateway authentication bug - Fixed with proper auth middleware
- Customer edit/add buttons - Fixed endpoints and navigation
- Dashboard layout - Redesigned for 5-column card layout
- User authentication display - Fixed across all pages
- Dark theme - Added support to all templates

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Unified authentication flow across all routes
- Standardized template data handling
- Created 7 detailed GitHub issues (#10-#17)
- Built SIP account management backend

## 📊 Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Authentication system with session management
- ✅ Basic UI navigation and layout
- ✅ Dashboard with stats cards
- ✅ Customer listing (with hardcoded data)
- ✅ Dark mode toggle
- ✅ SIP account backend (ready for UI)

### Ready for Implementation
- 🔄 Gateway management interface (backend ready, needs UI)
- 🔄 SIM card recharge system (models ready, needs logic)
- 🔄 Real-time features (WebSocket infrastructure needed)
