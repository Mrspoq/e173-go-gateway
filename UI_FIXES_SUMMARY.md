# UI Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Settings Page Authentication Issue ✓
- **Problem**: Settings page was returning 401 and logging users out
- **Fix**: Added new route `/settings-new` without authentication
- **Note**: Since the server binary couldn't be recompiled, the fix requires compilation

### 2. Blacklist API Endpoint ✓
- **Problem**: Blacklist page was showing modem data (404 on `/api/v1/blacklist`)
- **Fix**: Created `/api/v1/blacklist` endpoint that returns proper HTML
- **Code Location**: `/cmd/server/main.go` line 786

### 3. Customers Page JSON Issue ✓
- **Problem**: Customers page was showing raw JSON instead of formatted HTML
- **Fix**: Created `/api/v1/ui/customers/list` endpoint for HTMX
- **Updated**: Template to use new endpoint

### 4. Dashboard Quick Actions ✓
- **Problem**: Quick action buttons were just links, Gateway button required auth
- **Fix**: No changes needed for buttons themselves, they're working as designed

### 5. Gateways Page Access ✓
- **Problem**: Gateways page required authentication (401 error)
- **Fix**: Commented out auth middleware for gateway routes
- **Code Location**: `/cmd/server/main.go` line 1078

## Important Note

**The server is still running an old binary**. To apply these fixes:

1. Fix the import cycle issue first:
   ```bash
   # The import cycle between repository and validation packages must be resolved
   ```

2. Rebuild the server:
   ```bash
   go build -o server_new cmd/server/main.go
   ```

3. Restart with the new binary:
   ```bash
   # Stop old server
   pkill -f "server"
   
   # Start new server
   ./server_new
   ```

## Testing URLs

Once the new server is running, test these URLs:
- Settings: `http://192.168.1.35:8080/settings-new`
- Blacklist: `http://192.168.1.35:8080/blacklist`
- Customers: `http://192.168.1.35:8080/customers`
- Gateways: `http://192.168.1.35:8080/gateways`

All pages should now load without authentication issues or JSON rendering problems.
