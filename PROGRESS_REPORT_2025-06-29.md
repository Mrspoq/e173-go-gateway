- Added logout functionality
- Tested full authentication flow (redirect, login, access, logout)

### 2. UI/UX Improvements ✓
- **Dashboard**: Fixed card grid layout from 4 to 5 columns
- **Dashboard**: Removed full page refresh on initial load
- **Navigation**: Added user authentication status display
- **Navigation**: Shows "Welcome, [User Name]" when logged in
- **SIM Cards**: Fixed empty container display issue

### 3. Browser Automation MCP ✓
- Set up Puppeteer-based browser automation server
- Implemented UI analysis endpoints
- Added vision capabilities for screenshot analysis
- Running on port 3001 for continuous UI testing

### 4. GitHub Project Management ✓
- Created 4 project milestones (Phase 1-4)
- Created 3 epic issues for major features
- Created 3 current sprint issues
- Successfully integrated with GitHub API
- Milestones and issues now visible at:
  - https://github.com/mrspoq/e173-go-gateway/issues
  - https://github.com/mrspoq/e173-go-gateway/milestones

### 5. Build System ✓
- Fixed import cycle preventing compilation
- Created multiple working binaries:
  - `server_fixed` - Initial fixes
  - `server_auth_fixed` - Authentication improvements
  - Currently running with authentication support

## Pending Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Fix CDR/Blacklist Pages**: Pages still calling modems API incorrectly
2. **Customer Stats Display**: Still showing JSON instead of formatted HTML
3. **Gateway Page Routing**: Currently showing modems content instead of gateways

### Medium Priority  
1. **Customer SIP Account Management**: Database schema, API endpoints, UI components
2. **Settings Page Enhancement**: Implement tabbed interface (Filter, SIP, AMI, General)
3. **HTMX Polling Optimization**: Prevent memory leaks on page navigation

### Low Priority
1. **Production Environment Setup**: Docker, monitoring, deployment configuration
2. **Documentation**: API documentation, deployment guide, user manual

## Technical Debt
- Remove unused import packages
- Consolidate duplicate API endpoints
- Optimize database queries with better caching
- Implement proper error handling throughout

## Architecture Status

### Running Services
- **Main Server**: Port 8080 (Go/Gin with HTMX)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database with auth, customers, gateways tables
- **Redis**: Caching layer for performance
- **Browser Automation**: Port 3001 (Puppeteer MCP)

### Authentication Flow
```
User → Login Page → JWT Session → Dashboard
         ↓              ↓            ↓
      admin/admin   Cookie Set   Protected Routes
```

### GitHub Integration
```
Local Development → GitHub API → Issues/Milestones
        ↓                ↓              ↓
   Node.js Script   Octokit API   Project Tracking
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix Remaining UI Issues**
   - CDR/Blacklist page API calls
   - Customer stats JSON display
   - Gateway page routing

2. **Implement Customer SIP Management**
   - Database migrations
   - CRUD operations
   - Asterisk integration

3. **Enhance Settings Interface**
   - Tabbed navigation
   - Form validation
   - Real-time updates

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Docker configuration
   - Environment variables
   - Monitoring setup

## Notes for Next Session
- Asterisk configuration postponed until user can demonstrate dongle setup
- All UI fixes should be completed before moving to backend features
- GitHub project is now ready for multi-agent collaboration
- Browser automation MCP is available for continuous UI testing

## Repository Status
- **Commits**: Ready to commit when requested
- **Branch**: master
- **Modified Files**: 17 files with UI and authentication improvements
- **New Files**: Browser automation MCP, GitHub setup scripts
