# E173 Gateway Context Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Morocco Prefix Database
- Extracted official ANRT prefixes from PDF
- **IAM (Maroc Telecom)**: 58 prefixes
- **Orange Morocco**: 45 prefixes  
- **Inwi**: 66 prefixes
- Total: 169 assigned prefixes out of 200 possible (600-799)

### 2. Phone Validation
- Integrated official Google libphonenumber C++ library
- Created C++ wrapper with CGO bindings for Go
- Validates E.164 format (212 + 9 digits = 12 total)
- BUT: libphonenumber accepts unassigned prefixes (uses broad ranges)

### 3. WhatsApp Validation
- Integrated wa-validator.xyz API
- API Key: [removed for security]
- Rate limit: 5 TPS
- Average latency: 2 seconds
- 23% of random Morocco numbers have WhatsApp

### 4. Current Filter Logic
```
Source → Blacklist Check → Continue
Destination → Libphonenumber → Prefix Check → WhatsApp → Route/Reject
```

## What's Needed Next

### 1. Parallel Processing
- Current: Sequential processing (2s per number = slow)
- Needed: Worker pool with goroutines
- Target: Handle 100+ validations concurrently

### 2. Configurable Filters
Both source and destination need:
- Libphonenumber validation (on/off)
- WhatsApp validation (on/off)
- HLR validation (future)
- Blacklist/Graylist/Whitelist
- Custom rules

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Filter configuration UI
- Real-time testing
- Statistics dashboard
- List management (black/gray/white)

### 4. Database Updates
- filter_configs table
- graylist table
- whitelist table
- Validation cache

## Key Files
- `/root/e173_go_gateway/pkg/validation/libphonenumber.go` - C++ integration
- `/root/e173_go_gateway/pkg/validation/private_whatsapp.go` - WhatsApp API
- `/root/e173_go_gateway/pkg/service/filter_service.go` - Current filter logic
- `/root/e173_go_gateway/data/morocco_mobile_prefixes_correct.json` - ANRT prefixes
- `/root/e173_go_gateway/.env` - Contains WhatsApp API key

## Important Notes
- WhatsApp API is slow (2s) but reliable (0 errors/100 requests)
- Must validate length BEFORE WhatsApp to save API costs
- Morocco numbers: exactly 12 digits in E.164
- Libphonenumber doesn't know actual operator assignments
- Need our prefix database for accurate routing
