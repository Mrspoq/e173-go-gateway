- AMI connection configuration

**Technical Tasks**:
- Create gateway list UI with card layout
- Implement create/edit forms with AMI settings
- Add real-time status monitoring via AMI
- Implement gateway health checks
- Create gateway statistics aggregation

### 2. SIM Card Recharge System
**User Requirements**:
- Database of prepaid recharge codes
- Bulk selection with Shift/Cmd
- Sort by credits (ascending/descending)
- One-click bulk recharge
- SMS-based recharge with confirmation parsing
- Balance tracking (minutes, SMS, data)
- Expiry date management
- Promotion handling (e.g., â‚¬1 = 1 hour)

**Technical Tasks**:
- Create recharge codes table and model
- Implement AT command interface for SMS
- Build SMS parser for operator responses
- Create bulk operation UI with multi-select

- Update every second
- 5 stat cards in top row

**Technical Tasks**:
- Implement WebSocket server
- Create AMI event listener for call events
- Build real-time call tracking system
- Design active calls table UI
- Implement live cost calculation

### 4. CDR Enhancement with Filtering
**User Requirements**:

## API Endpoints to Create
- `/api/v1/gateways/*/status` - Real-time status
- `/api/v1/recharge/bulk` - Bulk recharge
- `/api/v1/calls/active` - Active calls list
- `/api/v1/cdr/export` - CDR export
- `/api/v1/customers/*/ips` - IP management

## UI Components to Build
- Gateway card component
- Multi-select table with Shift/Cmd
- Real-time call table
